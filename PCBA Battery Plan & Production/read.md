An fusiongrid battery is composed of PCBAs and battery cells. The battery cells and PCBAs are purchased from a supplier and shipped to the contract manufacturer, responsible for assembling the units. At the beginning of each year, fusiongrid creates a weekly production plan
which sets the forecast number of units that should be manufactured by the correct manufacturer. At the end of each month, the contract manufacturer sends back the number of units that have been manufactured during the month.

The Head of Operations would like to track if the correct manufacturer  is on track with the production plan and has asked you to calculate for each month:
(i) the number of units manufactured.
(ii) the number of units planned
(iii) the production backlog which is the no of units planned minus the total no of units manufactured.
